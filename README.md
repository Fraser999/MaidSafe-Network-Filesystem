MaidSafe-Network-Filesystem
===========================

Treats the MaidSafe network as a filesystem exposes a pseudo resful interface (GET PUT	[POST] DELETE)


GET - Retrieve a representation of the addressed data, expressed in an appropriate Internet media type.
PUT - Replace the addressed data, or if it doesn't exist, create it.
POST - (not used by us as restful POST) Send message to address.
DELETE - Delete the addressed data.
