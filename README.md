===========================

Treats the MaidSafe network as a filesystem exposes a pseudo resful interface (GET PUT	[POST] DELETE)

GET - Retrieve a representation of the addressed member of the collection, expressed in an appropriate Internet media type.	
PUT - Replace the addressed member of the collection, or if it doesn't exist, create it.	
POST - (not used by us) Not generally used. Treat the addressed member as a collection in its own right and create a new entry in it.
